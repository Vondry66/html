    <h1>Cutest baby</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Hello and welcome to my <em>humble</em> one-page website that explains why the <strong>Mazda RX-7 </strong><em>FD3S</em> is the cutest baby...<em>inhales...</em>
    <strong>in the world.</strong></h2><br>
    <p><strong><u><blink>Why is it cute ?</blink></u></strong></p>
    <ol>

    <p>The production of the third generation started in 1992 and (very sadly) ended in 2002.
        <br>Rumors are however, that Mazda want's to revive the rotary and maybe bring back something similar.
        Which would be great because that would be another cute baby I can't afford.<br>
        The final model (2002) was powered by 206 KW engine. <br><br>
        It was one of the first twin-turbocharged engines in commercial use. <br>
        The first turbo was low-rev. It made sure that the car goes vvvvvrap-rap-prap-prap-prap straight from idle.<br>
        The second turbo was high-rev. Which as you can guess by now, made this car a high-rpm beast.
